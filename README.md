Pirate Intelligent Agent

Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a pirate intelligent agent designed for the Treasure Hunt Game. This project demonstrates my ability to apply key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to a real-world problem. Specifically, I developed an agent capable of navigating a maze to find the treasure using deep Q-learning techniques.


Project Details

Provided Code
TreasureMaze.py: This file contains the implementation of the game environment, including the maze structure, game rules, and mechanics for actions like moving through the maze and detecting game outcomes (win, lose, or ongoing).
GameExperience.py: This file implements the experience replay mechanism, a critical component for training the neural network by storing and replaying episodes to improve learning.

Created Code
Jupyter Notebook: I developed the logic for training the intelligent agent using deep Q-learning. 
This includes:
Constructing and training a neural network to predict the best actions.
Implementing the training loop to optimize the agent’s performance.
Incorporating exploration vs. exploitation strategies to balance learning and action.
Logging the training progress and evaluating the agent’s win rate over epochs.

Connection to Computer Science
What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists design and develop algorithms, models, and systems to solve complex problems and advance technology. This work has broad applications across industries, from healthcare to entertainment, improving efficiency, accessibility, and innovation. Projects like this intelligent agent showcase how theoretical concepts, like reinforcement learning, can be applied to practical scenarios that emulate real-world challenges.

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?
As a computer scientist, I break down problems into smaller, manageable components, then design and implement solutions iteratively. 
For this project, I:
Analyzed the problem of navigating the maze.
Identified key requirements for the agent (e.g., learning optimal actions).
Implemented a neural network to predict actions and a training loop to optimize performance.
Debugged and refined the solution based on testing outcomes and metrics like win rate.
This systematic approach ensures a logical progression from problem identification to a working solution.

Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and Organization
Ethics is central to any AI development. For this project, ensuring the transparency of the agent’s behavior and avoiding biases in decision-making were my key considerations. For example, if this had  been applied to a real-world system, I would ensure that the underlying model provides explainable outputs, respects user data privacy, and adheres to safety protocols to prevent misuse. Additionally, ensuring the fairness and accessibility of AI systems to a diverse range of users is a vital responsibility for any computer scientist.
